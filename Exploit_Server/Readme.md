Exploit Server

A simple Node.js server for logging cookies and other logs sent via POST requests.
🚀 Getting Started

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install dependencies using npm install.
    Start the server using node server.js.
    Access the server from the client-side application and send POST requests to http://localhost:3000/server.

🔧 Configuration

    Modify the origin property in the cors middleware to allow requests from your client-side application.
    Customize the logging behavior by enabling or disabling logging to a file.

💡 Functionalities

    Logs cookies received via POST requests to /server endpoint.
    Supports CORS for cross-origin requests.
    Allows logging to a file based on user preference.

📝 Logging Preferences

When the server starts, it prompts the user to specify logging preferences:

    If logging to a file is desired, the user can provide the file name.
    If logging is not required, the server continues to run without logging.

🛑 Caution

    Ensure that the server is not exposed to unauthorized access.
    Use this tool responsibly and only for legitimate purposes.
